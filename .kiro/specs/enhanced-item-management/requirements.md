# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing FastAPI CRUD application for item management by adding comprehensive error handling, input validation, logging, search capabilities, and improved API documentation. The enhancement will transform the basic CRUD operations into a production-ready item management system with better user experience, monitoring, and maintainability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want comprehensive input validation and clear error messages, so that I can understand what went wrong and how to fix my requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits an item with invalid data THEN the system SHALL return a 422 status code with detailed validation errors
2. WHEN a user submits an item with a negative price THEN the system SHALL return a validation error message
3. WHEN a user submits an item with an empty name THEN the system SHALL return a validation error message
4. WHEN a user submits an item with a name longer than 100 characters THEN the system SHALL return a validation error message
5. IF a database connection fails THEN the system SHALL return a 503 status code with an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive logging and monitoring, so that I can track application performance and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any API endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL log the request method, path, and response status
2. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL log the error details with appropriate log levels
3. WHEN database operations are performed THEN the system SHALL log the operation type and execution time
4. WHEN the health check endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL log the health status
5. IF logging fails THEN the system SHALL continue to operate without crashing

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want to search and filter items, so that I can find specific items efficiently without retrieving all data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user searches by item name THEN the system SHALL return items containing the search term (case-insensitive)
2. WHEN a user filters by price range THEN the system SHALL return items within the specified minimum and maximum price
3. WHEN a user combines search and filter parameters THEN the system SHALL return items matching all criteria
4. WHEN a user provides invalid search parameters THEN the system SHALL return appropriate validation errors
5. WHEN no items match the search criteria THEN the system SHALL return an empty list with 200 status code

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want proper API documentation and response schemas, so that I can integrate with the API effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the API documentation THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
2. WHEN API responses are returned THEN the system SHALL include consistent metadata (timestamps, request IDs)
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL return standardized error response format
4. WHEN successful operations complete THEN the system SHALL return consistent success response format
5. IF the API schema changes THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility where possible

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want database connection pooling and transaction management, so that the application can handle concurrent requests efficiently and maintain data consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple concurrent requests are made THEN the system SHALL handle them efficiently using connection pooling
2. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL properly rollback transactions
3. WHEN creating or updating items THEN the system SHALL ensure atomic operations
4. WHEN the database is unavailable THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error responses
5. IF connection pool is exhausted THEN the system SHALL queue requests appropriately

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want rate limiting and security headers, so that the API is protected from abuse and follows security best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user makes too many requests THEN the system SHALL return a 429 status code with rate limit information
2. WHEN any request is made THEN the system SHALL include appropriate security headers in responses
3. WHEN CORS requests are made THEN the system SHALL handle them according to configured policies
4. WHEN requests include malicious content THEN the system SHALL sanitize or reject them appropriately
5. IF rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL provide clear information about when requests can resume
